# 🏠 HOUSING PRICE PREDICTION USING END TO END MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES

This repository contains a complete, real-world **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** to predict **median house prices** in California districts using various socio-economic and geographic features.
It is based on the classic dataset from the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron.

---

## 📌 Objective

> Build a regression model to predict **housing prices** using machine learning, while applying best practices in data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and evaluation.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

### 1. 📥 Get the Data

* Downloads and extracts the California housing dataset.
* Uses `pandas` to load it into a DataFrame.

### 2. 🔍 Explore and Visualize

* Basic info: null values, data types, statistical summary.
* Geospatial scatter plots of prices vs. coordinates.
* Correlation heatmaps to identify strong predictors.

### 3. 🧪 Split Data

* Uses `train_test_split()` and stratified sampling for reliable train/test separation.

### 4. 🧹 Prepare Data

* Missing values handled with `SimpleImputer`.
* Categorical features encoded using `OneHotEncoder`.
* Feature scaling applied using `StandardScaler`.

### 5. ⚙️ Train Models

* Trains and evaluates:

  * Linear Regression
  * Decision Tree Regressor
  * Random Forest Regressor

### 6. 🛠️ Fine-Tune Models

* Hyperparameter optimization using `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`.
* Feature importance analysis and error evaluation.

### 7. 🧾 Evaluate Final Model

* Tests the best model on the test set.
* Calculates RMSE and compares it to baseline.

### 8. 💾 Save Model

* Model is persisted using `joblib` or `pickle` for production deployment.
